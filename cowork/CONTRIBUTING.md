## 📝 Style Guide

### Writing Principles

1. **Practical over theoretical** - Focus on actionable knowledge
2. **Accuracy over marketing** - No invented stats, cite sources
3. **Specific over vague** - "OCR accuracy ~97% for vendor names" not "OCR is good"
4. **Examples included** - Every concept has a real example
5. **Beginner-friendly** - Knowledge workers, not developers

### Prompts

- **Always use CTOC format** (Context→Task→Output→Constraints)
- **Include file paths** in prompts (`~/Cowork-Workspace/input/`)
- **Specify output format** (Excel with formulas, Word with headers, etc.)
- **Add constraints** (currency, separators, regional settings)

Example:
```
CONTEXT: I have 15 PDF invoices from different vendors in ~/Cowork-Workspace/input/invoices/
TASK: Extract invoice data into a structured format
OUTPUT: Save as ~/Cowork-Workspace/output/invoices.xlsx with columns: Date, Vendor, Invoice#, Amount, Status
CONSTRAINTS: Use EUR currency, European Excel formula syntax (semicolons), flag amounts >1000 in red
```

### Documentation Structure

- **Headers**: Sentence case, not Title Case
- **Lists**: Parallel structure, consistent punctuation
- **Code blocks**: Specify language for syntax highlighting
- **Tables**: Use for comparisons, structured data
- **Collapsibles**: For long content that breaks flow

### Tone

- **Professional but approachable** - Not academic, not casual
- **Confident but honest** - Admit limitations, cite uncertainties
- **Helpful not patronizing** - Respect reader's intelligence
