# Semantic Anchors Catalog

> **Concept**: Alexandre Soyer
> **Source**: [github.com/LLM-Coding/Semantic-Anchors](https://github.com/LLM-Coding/Semantic-Anchors) (Apache-2.0)
> **Adapted for**: Claude Code workflows

## What Are Semantic Anchors?

LLMs are statistical pattern matchers. When you use **precise technical vocabulary**, you help Claude access the right patterns from its training data. Generic terms produce generic code; specific terms produce specific, well-structured code.

**Analogy**: Technical terms are GPS coordinates into Claude's knowledge base.

## CLAUDE.md Template with Semantic Anchors

```markdown
# Project Architecture

## Principles (Semantic Anchors)

### Architecture
- **Pattern**: Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
- **Domain modeling**: Domain-Driven Design tactical patterns (Aggregates, Value Objects, Domain Events)
- **Documentation**: ADR (Architecture Decision Records) for significant decisions

### Code Quality
- **Design**: SOLID principles, especially SRP and DIP
- **Refactoring**: Apply Fowler's catalog - Extract Method, Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
- **Naming**: Intention-revealing names, Screaming Architecture for packages

### Testing
- **Methodology**: TDD London School - outside-in, mock collaborators
- **Structure**: Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- **Coverage**: Test Pyramid - 70% unit, 20% integration, 10% E2E

### Error Handling
- **Pattern**: Railway Oriented Programming with Result<T, E>
- **Never**: Return null, throw for control flow
- **Always**: Use Option/Maybe for optional values

### API Design
- **Style**: REST Level 2 with proper HTTP verbs and status codes
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI 3.0 spec-first
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0 + PKCE for authentication

### Requirements
- **Format**: EARS syntax for formal requirements
- **User stories**: Connextra format with acceptance criteria
- **Discovery**: Event Storming for domain exploration
```

| "Add error handling" | "Use Railway Oriented Programming with Either monad" |

## Usage Tips

1. **Combine anchors**: "Apply Hexagonal Architecture with DDD tactical patterns and Railway Oriented error handling"

2. **Specify versions/authors**: "Following Kent Beck's TDD (2003)" is more specific than "TDD"

3. **Reference books**: "Clean Code Chapter 2 naming conventions" activates specific knowledge

4. **Name patterns explicitly**: "Strategy pattern" > "pluggable behavior"

5. **Use with XML tags**: Combine anchors with `<constraints>` and `<quality_criteria>` tags for maximum effect

---

> **Remember**: The goal is precision, not jargon. Use anchors that Claude has seen extensively in its training data. When in doubt, reference the authoritative source (book, paper, framework).
